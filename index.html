      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>New Hope Community Bikes started in 2008 as an initiative of New Hope Church. We're a non-profit registered charity, and we seek to get more people on affordable, reliable bicycles and to provide employment and job training opportunities for youth.</p>

      <p>We believe bicycles can help build a healthier, more environmentally friendly community; we believe that everyone should have access to affordable and efficient transportation. We build and restore bikes at a variety of price points and rider specifications, offering everything from cheap winter commuters to unique, one-of-a-kind custom bikes.</p>

        <h1>DIY (Do-It-Yourself)</h1>
        <p>New Hope Community Bikes is a non-profit and exists for anyone wishing to use our space. Tools and shop space is available whenever the shop is open on a first-come-first-served basis. This means if it's busy you may have to wait for someone to finish at a workspace before you can start your own DIY. We offer a sliding scale for tool use and stand space: $0-5/hour if you do the work yourself, and $0-10/hour if we help out. If you don't have the money to pay, that's okay. Pay what you can, or pay next time.</p>
